# Angular Signals + Map Join

A focused Angular interview exercise demonstrating how to combine two related collections efficiently while using writable signals and derived `computed()` state.

## What this demonstrates

- Angular writable signals for source state
- A read-only `computed()` signal for derived state
- An O(n + m) in-memory left join using `Map`
- Immutable array updates with `set()` and `update()`
- Modern Angular template control flow with `@for` and `@if`
- `OnPush` change detection
- Strict TypeScript and `ReadonlyArray`
- Unit tests for matching, missing data, duplicates, immutability, and signal recomputation

## Run locally

Requires Node.js `^22.22.3`, `^24.15.0`, or `^26.0.0`.

```bash
cd examples/angular-signals-map-join
npm install
npm start
```

Open `http://localhost:4200`.

## Run checks

```bash
npm run build
npm test
```

## Core algorithm

```ts
export function combineBirds(
  birds: ReadonlyArray<Bird>,
  details: ReadonlyArray<BirdDetails>
): ReadonlyArray<CombinedBird> {
  const detailsByBirdId = new Map<string, BirdDetails>(
    details.map(detail => [detail.birdId, detail])
  );

  return birds.map(bird => ({
    ...bird,
    details: detailsByBirdId.get(bird.id) ?? null
  }));
}
```

Building the `Map` costs O(m). Traversing the bird collection costs O(n). The overall time complexity is approximately **O(n + m)** with **O(m)** additional space.

A nested solution such as `birds.map(bird => details.find(...))` can degrade toward **O(n × m)** because it may scan the details array once for every bird.

## Signals design

```ts
readonly birds = signal<ReadonlyArray<Bird>>(INITIAL_BIRDS);
readonly birdDetails = signal<ReadonlyArray<BirdDetails>>(
  INITIAL_BIRD_DETAILS
);

readonly combinedBirds = computed<ReadonlyArray<CombinedBird>>(() =>
  combineBirds(this.birds(), this.birdDetails())
);
```

There are three related protections here:

1. TypeScript `readonly` prevents the component property from being reassigned.
2. Angular `computed()` exposes derived state without `set()` or `update()` methods.
3. `ReadonlyArray<CombinedBird>` prevents callers from mutating the returned collection through the type system.

The source signals remain writable because they represent application state. `combinedBirds` remains derived rather than being manually synchronized as a third writable signal.

## Interview explanation

> I index the secondary collection into a Map using the shared identifier, then make one pass over the primary collection and perform average constant-time lookups. That reduces the join from a possible O(n × m) nested search to approximately O(n + m). In Angular, the two source collections are writable signals and the joined collection is a computed signal. Angular tracks both dependencies and invalidates the computed value whenever either source changes. The computed result is lazy, memoized, and cannot be updated directly, so I avoid duplicated state and manual synchronization.

## Senior-level follow-up topics

- What should happen when the details collection contains duplicate IDs?
- Should unmatched primary records be retained, dropped, or reported?
- At what data size should the join move to the backend or database?
- How would server-side filtering and cursor pagination change the design?
- Which database indexes would support the equivalent SQL join?
- How would you measure memory use, request latency, payload size, and rendering time?
